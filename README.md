The aim of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify brain scan images based on whether there is a brain tumor present or not. For this project, we have a brain tumor dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luluw8071/brain-tumor-mri-datasets). This dataset contains over 4000 images which we can use to create a model that achieves our goal.
